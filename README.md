# Steganography
 
Description: This project is aimed to understand the topic of steganography through implementing the methods of Least Significant bits (LSB) and Neural Network (NN). The code is tested on three different data sets with the result of the loss function, which is calcualted by the root mean squared error. 

## Compile/Run the code

The codes are written on jupyter notebooks using python. One can review it by opening the jupter notebooks "LSB_implement" and "NN_implement".


## Contributors
This project is written by Haley Feng with codes of LSB and NN provided by Github users kelvins and alexandremuzio, respectively.
